Hi Mr Amir Hossain,

I hope you are well. I recently found job postings for Software Engineer Intern (Salesforce)(https://bit.ly/4glPOxn) and Software Engineer Intern (Odoo)(link: http://bit.ly/3ZrfEK4)) at BJIT. I believe these roles align well with my skills and interests.

I am a competitive programmer, having participated in the ICPC Dhaka Regional 2023 (97th out of 223 teams). Solved over 1000 problems and participated in 100+ online contests and am proficient in C, C++, Java, Python, and Golang.

My personal project experience includes:
Comfort Cocoon: A hotel booking system(Golang), Snippetbox: A platform similar to Ubuntu Pastebin(Golang), AgriSmart: An ML-based agri recommendation system.(PHP, Python).

For more details, I have attached my resume. I would greatly appreciate it if you could kindly provide me with a referral for either of these positions.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am excited to hear from you.

Best regards,
Soyaib Rahman
